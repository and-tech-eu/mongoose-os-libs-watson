# IBM Warson IoT Platform support library for Mongoose OS

This library provides [IBM Watson IoT Platform](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/) support for Mongoose OS.

## QuickStart setup

The easiest way to setup Watson IoT Platform cloud connection is by using `mos watson-iot-setup`.
```
$ mos watson-iot-setup
```

This does not require any credentials and will set up the device for [QuickStart cloud dashboard](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/) connectivity.
With QuickStart dashboard, you will be able to send data from the device at a limited rate but device management (sending commands to the device) is not available.

## Own IBM Cloud Account setup.
